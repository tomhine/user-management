# Hi Reckless Devs ğŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to look at this project!

## Setup

When you set up the project make sure to seed the database, I have a seeder setup with 10 dummy users and an admin user.

You can log in as the admin user with these credentials;

email:
```
admin@example.com
```

password:
```
password
```
